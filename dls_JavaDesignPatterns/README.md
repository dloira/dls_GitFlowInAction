# Design patterns implemented in Java

Here, you could find a bunch of software design patterns which are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to solve common problems when designing an application or system. Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven development paradigms.

The solutions have been developed by experienced programmers and architects from the open source community. The patterns can be browsed by their high level descriptions or by looking at their source code. The source code examples are well commented and can be thought as programming tutorials how to implement a specific pattern. We use the most popular battle-proven open source Java technologies.

The content is structured following a human easy pattern, where everybody could find whatever drilling down the folders hierarchy (maybe what you are looking for is not in this repository, that's another topic).

Enjoy it!!
